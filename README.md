Mid Atlantic Atlantic Chub Mackerel Fishery Dependent Data

The goal of this work has been to understand inter- and intra-annual variations in age and length composition of ACM.

We have integrated these data with those collected from previous fishery-dependent sampling work (earlier than 2016). 

The intention of this effort is to contribute to a continued understanding of the length and age-composition of harvest and serve to expand the time series of annual length composition for inclusion into stock assessment.
