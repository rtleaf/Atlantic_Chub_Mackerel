## Introduction

We continue to work with industry partners (J. Kaelin, Lund’s Fisheries and M. Lapp, SeaFreeze Ltd.) to characterize the age and length composition of Atlantic Chub Mackerel(ACM) in the commercial fishery. This effort was initiated in 2016 using funding provided by the [Science Center for Marine Fisheries](www.scemfis.org/). SCeMFiS is a National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC).

The goal of this work has been to understand inter- and intra-annual variations in age and length composition of ACM and we have integrated these data with those collected from previous fishery-dependent sampling work (earlier than 2016). The intention of this effort is to contribute to a continued understanding of the length and age-composition of harvest and serve to expand the time series of annual length composition for inclusion into stock assessment.

## Methods

Working with industry partners, we have requested that both SeaFreeze and Lund’s Fisheries collect a random subset of the catch of ACM and keep them frozen at their facility, labeled with the date of collection. Depending on the volume of samples, we have made trips to Lund’s Fisheries in the late summer/early fall (2016, 2017, 2018) to collect and sample fish (determine length, weight, and collect otoliths and gonads) onsite. In other years, including in 2019, we have requested that frozen samples be shipped to the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory, Ocean Springs, MS. This year (2019) the fishery did not encounter ACM until late in the season (Table 1).

In 2016 to 2017 we focused our efforts on describing the length-at-age, weight-at-length, and maturity dynamics of Atlantic Chub Mackerel. These analysis have been published (Daley and Leaf, *J. Northw. Atl. Fish. Sci.*, 50: 1–12). In our most recent effort, in 2019, we continued to collect and characterize the length composition of Atlantic Chub Mackerel from the fishery. Collection of this informtion from the stock is intended to infrom quantitative stock assessment, using data limited approaches. 

Based on aggregated length-composition information, of all years, the length composition exhibits a slight bimodal pattern with peaks at 25 cm TL and another at 32 cm TL. There is considerable variation in the patterns of annual length composition encountered in the commercial fishery and in general single year harvest records are not bimodal, instead, the mean of the annual length composition distributions are generally unimodal and either centered or skewed to smaller lengths (e.g. years 2007, 2008, 2012, 2018) or centered or skewed to larger lengths (e.g. years 2007, 2008, 2012, 2014).

The harvested fish in 2019, provided to us from SeaFreeze Ltd., exhibited a strong bimodal pattern. One trip in particular resulted in the harvest of small ACM, with a mean FL of approximately 22 cm. Large individuals, 30 to 35 cm, were also harvested as they have been nearly every year, as they have been since 2012 (Table 2).

Based on the historical analysis of length composition, there is no relationship between the month of harvest and size of the fish.
